# rmsedit

An RMS editor for the DOS classic Dungeon Explorer (1990) by John Murphy.

This is separate from [explorer-utils](https://github.com/footballhead/explorer-utils) because everything is reimplemented in Rust.

## Requirements

* Rust 2018
* [Dungeon Explorer files](https://www.dosgamesarchive.com/download/dungeon-explorer/). These must be extracted to the current working directory.

## Building and Running

First, extract the Dungeon Explorer files to the current working directory. Then:

    cargo build
    cargo run
